    <h1>A browser-controlled virtual MIDI keyboard</h1>

    <p>Github repository here: <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/midi-with-node">https://github.com/Pomax/midi-with-node</a></p>

    <p>This page sends key events to the small MIDI server that's running on port 8080, which can be routed to any DAW or MIDI input device that has the ability to select its MIDI event source.</p>

    <p>Play keys with your computer keyboard, 'q' through 'p' are C3 through E4, 'z' through 'm' are the C2 octave. Use your up and down arrow key to shift key octaves up/down respectively.</p>
